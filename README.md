Step 3: Select the equipment from the presets list to autofill the fix price and purchase price values. **For modded equipment, or equipment not supported by the tool**: fix price equates to the cost of one fix action, while purchase price is the base value of the equipment, or the replace price if the equipment is at 0% condition.

Step 4: Calculate! The bottom display should now provide the number of repair steps, as well as whether you should replace after that number of repairs. Additional information pertaining to the decisions not displayed are outputted to the `engine_log.txt` file in the appdata.
